# RxBingMap
A reactive extension for the Bing web map plotting tool. 
RxBingMaps is an open-source RxJS binding for the Bing Maps Rendering web control, that nicely integrates with Bing core navigation and mapping services, through the open source project [Rx-Bing-Services](https://github.com/erikschlegel/RxBingServices).<br>

<p>This project was designed and implemented with simplicity and usability as it's primary goal. In the example below, you can visualize custom pushpin icons to represent the results of the Bing spatial data(<i>whats around me</i>) REST service, and leveraging the RxJS to orchestrate all the asynch callbacks and event streams.></p>
