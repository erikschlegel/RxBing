A reactive extension for the Bing web map plotting tool. 
This is an open-source RxJS binding for the Bing Maps Rendering web control, that nicely integrates with Bing core navigation and mapping services, through the open source project [Rx-Bing-Services](https://github.com/erikschlegel/RxBingServices)

This project was designed and implemented with simplicity and usability as it's primary goal.
